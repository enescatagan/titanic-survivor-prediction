titanic-survivor-prediction
=============================

This project was created to examine the disaster that occurred during the voyage of the famous Titanic ship and predict the surviving passengers using machine learning techniques.

## Project Objectives

1. Frame the problem and Design the System
2. Examine
    * Load the Data
    * Get Bird View from data and Analyze features
    * Split data appropriately
3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
4. Discover new features (*Feature Engineering*)
5. Prepare the Data
    * Handle Missing Values
    * Remove Outliers
    * Handle Categorical Values Appropriately
    * Feature Extraction
    * Feature Transformation
    * Scale the Data
    * Create a preprocessing pipeline to do all of this
6. Train Models, evaluate and Select 3 to 5 models perform best
7. Tune selected models, evaluate and Select the best-performing 2 or 3 model
8. Ensemble best-performing models,compare performances, and select the final model.
9. Conclusion
    * Check out the final model's predictions
    * Save the model
    * Create Conclusion from project, and project steps
10. Do your best and Remember to have fun üòäüôè
